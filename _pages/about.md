I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [College of Computing and Data Science](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working with [Prof. Chunyan Miao](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00084). My research interests include Deepfake Detection, Misinformation Detection, Multimedia Forensics, and Generative AI.

Before joining NTU, I received my Ph.D. dgree in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), supervised by [Dr. Kam Pui Chow](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/chow). I received my double-major B.S. degree in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) and [Applied & Computational Mathematical Sciences](https://acms.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle.
