I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at [School of Computing (SoC)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), National University of Singapore (NUS), working with [Prof. Mohan Kankanhalli](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/mohan/). My research interests include Deepfake Detection, Misinformation Detection, Multimedia Forensics, and Generative AI.

Before joining NUS, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at [College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I received my Ph.D. degree in [Computer Science (CS)](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), supervised by [Dr. Kam Pui Chow](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/chow). I received my double-major B.S. degree in [Computer Science (CS)](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) and [Applied & Computational Mathematical Sciences (ACMS)](https://acms.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle.
